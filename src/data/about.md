# Intro

Hi, I am Marco, a passionate and curious guy who would love to take actively part in the technology revolution that is shaping the world. This page is dedicated to describing who I am, what I do with my time, and why I do it. So, if you're curious to uncover the life of a crazy and quirky computer engineer, don't hesitate to read a bit about me. Who knows, we might discover some shared passions along the way!


# Some history

Since my early years, I have been captivated by the wonders of technology. From my first encounter with computers to exploring the limitless possibilities offered by the internet, I have been fascinated by how technology empowers us to connect, create, and innovate. I believe that a seamless integration of technology into our lives can lead us towards remarkable discoveries and advancements that will undoubtedly propel the human race forward. This love for technology has only grown stronger over time, driving me to pursue a career in a field where I can actively contribute to its evolution.

Throughout my academic journey at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/corsi/corsi-di-laurea-magistrale/M/2022-ing-ind-inf-magord-270-mi-481-computer-science-and-engineering-ingegneria-informatica), I have dedicated myself to gaining a comprehensive understanding of Computer Science and its potential applications. I have earned a master degree in Computer Science Engineering, and actively participated in various technological projects, which have allowed me to develop a solid foundation in areas such as Machine Learning, Computer Security, Software and Data Engineering. Moreover, I have consistently stayed up-to-date with the latest advancements in the tech industry, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

During the last year of my studies, I had the privilege of starting work as an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Engineer at [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/it/it/), a leading global technology and consulting firm.
After around one year and a half of work at Price, I moved out, starting a new job as Tech Product Owner at Mediaset, one of the largest Italian Media companies.

Of course, my life is not all about work and computer science indeed, I nurture a multitude of passions, some quite common, others decidedly less so... here are a few.

# Things that I like

- Cooking (I really love cooking for friends, in particular I like to experiment complex recipes with dough and sourdough like Pizza and Panettone. Have a look at some of my "creations" in the gallery!).
- Preparing cocktails and wine tastings.
- Solve puzzles and play board games (I go crazy for escape rooms).
- Sports (I've been lucky enough to have practiced a wide array of sports over the years, including beach volley, tennis, soccer, basketball, skiing, swimming, and padel. Unfortunately, I'm terrible at each and every one of them).
- Playing the piano (I have taken piano lessons for 6 years, so feel free to chat me for a jam session, but please don't ask me to sing eheh).
- Nerd stuff (Hackathons, videogames, anime, manga and Star Wars).
- Movies and tv series.
- [Photography](https://www.instagram.com/marcobalenoo/) (I always travel with my Nikon in order to take pictures of the beautiful places and peoples that I have the pleasure to visit, in 2015 I won Liliana Urtamonti [still nature](https://www.instagram.com/p/1Ql0DrivyoekSE2An1JIdCRMaRkLcDW62WAho0/) photography contest).
- Financial independence.

# Travel

I was born in Monza (Italy) and have always lived near Milan.
However, I have been fortunate enough to have two incredible parents who made me travel a lot.
By the age of 21, I had already tasted the flavors of different cultures and explored various countries, including Japan, the United States, England, Spain, Portugal, Croatia, France, Cuba, and Tunisy. These experiences ignited in me a deep love for the world and a dream to explore it in its entirety. To cherish these memories and motivate myself to travel every year, I've dedicated this paragraph to documenting the places I have the privilege to visit each year:

- 2019 - I have seen the wonders of Japan.
- 2020 - Has been an Italian summer, I explored with my girlfriend the whole Elba island and then we moved to the Tuscan hinterland to explore Florence.
- 2021 - Sicily (Egadi and Trapani) and Switzerland (Grindelwald, Berna and a lot of hikings).
- 2022 - Sardinia and Ibiza (the wild side) and Venice in December.
- 2023 - A lot of travels this year! Umbria, wine tastings in Tuscany, Nice, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Munich, Copenhagen and the Norway's fjords (thanks Interrail!).
- 2024 - An incredible week spent at Faroe islands, such a wonderful and magical place to visit. After that, interrail again (the last time probably), One Country Pass, all around Spain, we visited Barcellona, Valencia, Sevilla, Madrid and San Sebastian, wonderful cities and tons of paellas!

# Fun facts

- I have on my balcony a gas oven who can reach up to 500Â°C, which I use to cook my pizzas.
- At the age of 15, I developed a passion for magic and since then, I've amassed a collection of several hundred decks of cards, some of which are now considered extremely rare. If you scroll through my Instagram feed, you might come across some photos of my [decks](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPXnn4jgtAs/) and even a few [magic tricks](https://www.instagram.com/p/BNj0YD5jYxE/) that could leave you amazed...
- As you might have understood, I love collecting stuff, I have a collection of cards, board games, Star Wars legos, puzzles and also a small collection of Gins (that will last until I will drink them all).
- In 2022, I obtained first level sommelier certificate.

# I dream of

- leave my trace in the world.
- visit all continents, especially Antarctica.
- learn at least five different languages.
- live a peaceful life surrounded by the people I love.
- you calling to offer me a cool job.
